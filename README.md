**1: Lint and its Usage in Android Studio ?**

  * 1.What exactly is lint?

  Lint is a code scanning tool supplied by Android Studio that identifies, suggests, and corrects incorrect or dangerous code in a project.
  
  We’ve all been using Lint since we first started using Android Studio because it comes standard with support for Lint in every project. 
  The Lint will notify you of any errors found in your code, along with some suggestions and a warning level. You may use the advice to make 
  changes to your code. Lint’s biggest feature is that you may utilize it any way you see fit. If you provide a certain type of error in your 
  project, the Lint will only display that sort of mistake. Lint is adaptable in nature. Android Studio automatically executes the inspection 
  process when you create your project, but you can also examine your code manually or from the command line using Lint.
